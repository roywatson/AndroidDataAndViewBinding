### "AndroidDataAndViewBinding" example project by:

This is a simple example that strips out a lot of generally accepted architectural components and other proclaimed best practices. It is using the minimum of dependencies, frameworks and libraries in order to avoid obscuring the illustration of data and view binding. I have added comments (beginning with "WATSON") to indicate code that is required achieve the intended goal.

##### Branches:

- "start" branch is the raw templated project created by Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2. This is supplied for comparison purposes.
- "complete" branch is the example/tutorial application where the "magic"üòÄ happens. *This is the current branch*

##### This example demonstrates/teaches:

- LiveData
- Data Binding
- View Binding

##### This example also includes/uses:

- Kotlin
- Corroutines
- View Model Lifecycle
- AtomicBoolean

### How to best use this demo:

The starting point of this app was the template for a new project in Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2 called ‚ÄúFragment + ViewModel‚Äù and using Kotlin. You can create an empty project based on that template and compare it to this project to discern what needs to be done to get your project started with Data and/or View Binding. I have annotated the parts I altered to acheive this with comments that begin with "WATSON".
